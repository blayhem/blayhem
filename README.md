- :hammer_and_wrench: I use React, Redux, GraphQL, Styled components/SASS, Nextjs and a bunch of other stuff (not necessarily together! :boom:)
- :mega: You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/blayhem/), [merveilles](https://merveilles.town/@dfr), or my ~~WIP~~ [minimal website](https://dfr.now.sh/).
