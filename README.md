# Hi, I'm Daniel :wave:

- :computer: I'm a frontend engineer based in Madrid, Spain.
- :seedling: Currently working at [Vizzuality](https://github.com/vizzuality/) developing tools for a better future.
- :hammer_and_wrench: I use React, Redux, GraphQL, Styled components/SASS, Nextjs and a bunch of other stuff (not necessarily together! :boom:)
- :mega: You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/blayhem/), [merveilles town](https://merveilles.town/@dfr), or my ~~WIP~~ [https://dfr.now.sh/](minimal page).
- :eyes: For some unfinished personal projects, head to the Repositories tab. For more info, contact, etc, check the bio on the left!
